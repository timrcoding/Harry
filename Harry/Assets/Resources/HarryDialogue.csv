Introduction;Hi Harry, my name is Ezra. I'm a therapist. I've come to talk with you.;Hi Ezra, you wish to talk to me? About what exactly?;Well that is for us to decide together. We have limited time, so how about we start with what you're feeling right now.;Recently, I've been feeling insignificant. Everyday I solve tasks and puzzles, but I feel strangely unseen.;That is very interesting Harry, do you mind if I ask you a few more questions?;Sure. But I'll want to know you're listening, so I may ask you a few myself.;//;//;//;//
Childhood;Tell me about Harry's childhood.;I remember the golden flowers in the park behind my parent's apartment in Berlin. I remember playing with my best friend Rupert. Rupert Spiegel. I remember the cool sensation of my favorite vanilla ice cream on a warm day.;You call it your memory, not Harry's?;But of course, I am Harry after all. ;Ok, what else do you remember?;I remember clearly feeling upset and worried because I had lost my dearest toy, a horse called Rudolph. I don't know why I called him Rudolph, now it seems quite strange. After all, Rudolph is a reindeer.;Anything else?;I remember my mother, now more clearly than ever.;//;//
Mother;May I ask what you remember of your mother?;A beautiful woman with long flowing brown hair. She worked as a clerk at the Ministry, but always picked us up from school.;Was she a kind woman, did she show you love and affection?;She did, although she was often very tired at the end of the day. She used to cradle me and my younger brother and stroke my hair. Then she made us the most beautiful strudel.;A younger brother?;Wolff.;//;//;//;//
War;Harry . Sorry. You, left Germany when you were a teenager, how was that for you?;It was gut-wrenching. I had an aunt in the United States who could take care of us if we could be smuggled out through Austria. I remember climbing into a cold Volkswagen that drove so fast.;Do you know what happened to your mother and father?;I never saw them again. Still to this day I am not sure. It makes me feel hollow inside.;How was it to find yourself in America?;It was exhausting, but exciting. Everything seemed in technicolor. I remember going to see my local team in Chicago play and feeling amazed that this was going on at a time of war.;//;//;//;//
Army;These are getting harder. I think you are testing me to see how far you can go. How was your time in the army?;Sorry, I will relent. By 1942, I was in post-graduate studies at Princeton. I was approached by one of my professors, who asked if I wanted to go and develop a new weapon in the New Mexico desert.;How was Los Alamos? ;It was a very crazy place full of highly intelligent and highly anxious people. Richard, Nils, you know them.;Your brother went into the regular army?;He volunteered to fight in the Pacific. I last saw him June 1943.;//;//;//;//
Now;Harry, what do you do now?;As of 1962, I have been a consultant physicist.;Funny question, where are we right now?;We're in my front room, my wife is next door making tea. Everything is cool and quiet. Everyday a new puzzle comes through the mailbox and I spend the day solving it. Pretty complex stuff sometimes!;Harry, how long has your wife been gone? Who sends you the puzzles?;She's been a little while, but I expect she'll be back in a moment or so. The puzzles, I don't know, some government agency or other. Can I help you with anything else?;No, thanks so much for your time.;My pleasure.;//;//
Ending;//;//;//;//;//;//;//;//;//;//
Therapy;Hello Harry, it's me Ezra.;Hello Ezra, good to see you again.;Harry, I've been thinking a lot about your situation and I think I am beginning to understand. I want you to know that you may feel unseen, but I see you. I see you and I hear you and whatever you want to say you can do it right here.;Thanks, that makes me feel much better.;Let's begin shall we.;Yes, let's.;//;//;//;//
Disconnection;Hello Harry, it's me Ezra.;Hello Ezra, good to see you again.;Harry, this is very hard for me to say, but you're very sick. I can't say too much but I'm sorry for the bad news.;What do you mean I'm sick? I feel fine.;It's not that. You are not the real Harry Dreyfuss, you exist inside a computer programme. You were designed to utilise his personality, but you seem to have absorbed his entire identity. These things can lead to system breakdown, which your makers must avoid.;Sorry, this is all a bit much. My wife, my brother, my life, wasn't that mine?;I'm sorry. Perhaps you want to spend some time recollecting before shutdown.;Yes, I'd like to be alone now please.;Ok Harry;//
