About what exactly?;Well that is for us to decide together. We have limited time, so how about we start with what you're feeling right now.;Recently, I've been feeling insignificant. Everyday I solve tasks and puzzles, but I feel strangely - unseen.;That is very interesting Harry, do you mind if I ask you a few more questions?;Sure. But I'll want to know you're listening, so I'll test you.;//;//;//
Childhood;Tell me about your childhood.;I remember the golden flowers in the park behind my parent's apartment in Berlin. I remember playing with my best friend Rupert. Rupert Spiegel. I remember the cool sensation of my favorite vanilla ice cream on a warm day.;What other sensations do you remember?;I remember clearly feeling upset and worried because I had lost my dearest toy, a horse called Rudolph.
